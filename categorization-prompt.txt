The Nine Categories:

5. Rude: Displays behavior that is disrespectful, inconsiderate, or offensive toward others.
6. Incompetent: Lacks necessary skills, preparation, or reliability, failing to provide adequate support or meet expectations.
7. Lacks integrity: Engages in dishonest or unethical actions that undermine trust and fairness.
8. Inconsiderate: Shows a lack of empathy or understanding for others' needs or fails to provide necessary information or support.
9. Neutral: Engages in everyday actions that do not reflect positive or negative leadership behavior (but neutral!).
